# GTFS
GTFS - Galactic Transport File Server.  Minimalist approach to serving a whole bunch of files to people anonymously but basically locked down.
The end goal is to have a simple server that you plug a usb3 hard drive into that shares out that hard drive.
Currently it's just a specific hard drive's name and not just any hard drive you have on hand.


# Hardware
Pi4 is pretty necessary for reasonable speed. You can serve files from a Pi3 but it's a bit painful.

# Software 
Samba plus a bit of configuration sauce.


# Where's the beef?
This is a placeholder and after defcon instructions on making your own GTFS will be posted.
